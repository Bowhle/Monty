# Monty Bytecode Interpreter

## Description
The **Monty Bytecode Interpreter** is a simple interpreter for Monty ByteCodes, a scripting language that operates with a unique stack (or queue). This project involves creating a program that reads and executes Monty bytecode files.

Monty bytecode files have a `.m` extension and contain a series of instructions, one per line, that are executed in sequence. The interpreter processes these instructions and manipulates the stack accordingly.
